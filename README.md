# BankOfWayne Bot - BOW

On the discord server people will post things to buy, etc.. and I like my gadgets, so I started replying with Bank Manager Of Wayne Says not allowed, etc, so I created a bot to automatically reply for me. 

There are two text files, watchPhrases.txt and responses.txt. The watchPhrases file containes all the words that the bot will respond to. The responses.txt is all the possiable responses.

I have to mentioned and so does the wathcPhrase for the bot to reply.
